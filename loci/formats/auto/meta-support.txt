# This file documents the metadata support for each file format that
# Bio-Formats can handle. Default value for unlisted properties is Missing,
# indicating that the property cannot be represented in the format, or our
# knowledge regarding the property regarding this format is incomplete.

# To define the status of a property, use the syntax:
#
#     Entity.Property = Status [Comment]
#
# "Status" is one of Yes, No, Partial or Missing.
# There is usually no need to specify Missing status, as it is the default.
#
# "Comment" is optional extra text for specifying further details, such as
# when the status changed. This value can include a revision, a ticket, a
# datestamp or any other appropriate information.
#
# As a shortcut for every property of a given entity, you can write:
#
#     Entity [Comment]
#
# Examples:
#
#     Dimensions = Yes since r2351
#     Objective.NominalMagnification = Yes added on 2008 Jan 8
#     ImagingEnvironment.Temperature = Partial see ticket #167 for details
