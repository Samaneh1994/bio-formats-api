LOCI Bio-Formats things to do (either Melissa or Curtis):

QuickTime:
* Implement LegacyQTWriter based on ImageJ QT writer plugin.
* Implement native QTWriter for saving uncompressed QuickTime movies.
* Implement jpeg and rle codecs for QTReader.

PICT:
* Implement native PictReader, falling back to LegacyPictReader if necessary.
* Use new PictReader in OpenlabReader.

Implement readers for other file formats listed at
    http://www.loci.wisc.edu/visbio/formats.html

Adapt VisBio to take advantage of LOCI Bio-Formats package.

Eventually (later) implement an alternative method for pixel extraction, other
than the BufferedImage one (such "byte[] openBytes(String, int)" in addition to
"BufferedImage openImage(String, int)"), for use with OMERO.
