LOCI Bio-Formats things to do (either Melissa or Curtis):

PICT:
* Implement native PictReader, falling back to LegacyPictReader if necessary.
* Use new PictReader in OpenlabReader.

Leica reader:
* Recognize Leica-style TIFFs (INI-style ImageDescription tag)
* Read key/value pairs
* Parse associated LEI file referenced within TIFF comment

Fluoview reader:
* Read key/value pairs in ImageDescription

Bio-Rad reader:
* Parse extended notes more thoroughly (e.g., AXIS_2, AXIS_3, AXIS_4)

TIFF writer:
* Make writer work with alternate DataBuffer/SampleModel configurations

Support RGB output in writers:
* AVI
* QuickTime

QuickTime:
* jpeg codec
* rle codec
* svq3 codec (lower priority)

Implement readers for other file formats:
* Amersham Biosciences GEL
* Fluoview FV1000 (OIB/OIF)
* DICOM
* Anything else listed online: http://www.loci.wisc.edu/visbio/formats.html

Adapt VisBio to take advantage of LOCI Bio-Formats package.

Eventually (later) implement an alternative method for pixel extraction, other
than the BufferedImage one (such "byte[] openBytes(String, int)" in addition to
"BufferedImage openImage(String, int)"), for use with OMERO.
