QuickTime:
* svq3 codec (lower priority)

Implement readers for other file formats:
* Fluoview FV1000 OIB
* DICOM
* Anything else listed online: http://www.loci.wisc.edu/ome/formats.html

Adapt VisBio to take advantage of LOCI Bio-Formats package.

Eventually (later) implement an alternative method for pixel extraction, other
than the BufferedImage one (such "byte[] openBytes(String, int)" in addition to
"BufferedImage openImage(String, int)"), for use with OMERO.

Some Metamorph TIFF comments have "key: value" pairs separated by newlines.
These should be parsed into metadata and culled from the comment. But be
careful not to parse lines that are not key/value pairs.
