LOCI Bio-Formats things to do (either Melissa or Curtis):

Implement readers for file formats listed at
    http://www.loci.wisc.edu/visbio/formats.html

Implement robust native writers for AVI and QT formats.

Possibly implement an alternative method for pixel extraction, other than the
BufferedImage one (such "byte[] openBytes(String, int)" in addition to
"BufferedImage openImage(String, int)"), for use with OMERO.

Solve problem created when we have multiple readers for a single file type
(e.g., LegacyZVIReader and ZeissZVIReader) that each handle a different subset
of images.
  * The easiest solution is for the "faster" reader to be dominant, but call
    the "slower" reader directly if it detects that it cannot handle the file.
  * Another possibility is to expand isThisType(String) to do more than look at
    the file extension for those formats, but instead check inside the file,
    but in general that method could become quite expensive or complex.

Simultaneous use of multiple QT forms to read from multiple QuickTime files
(one per form) must be made more efficient, or else the native QT reader must
be improved to handle all codecs used by our sample data. The same goes for the
Openlab form.

Adapt VisAD to use/include Bio-Formats package. Deprecate old logic.

Adapt VisBio to use LOCI Bio-Formats package.
