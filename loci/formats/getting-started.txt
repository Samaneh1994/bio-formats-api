              Bio-Formats Getting Started Guide by Melissa Linkert

This document is a brief guide to writing new Bio-Formats file format readers.

All format readers should extend either loci.formats.FormatReader or a reader
in loci.formats.in.

---=== Methods to override ===---

boolean isThisType(byte[]) : 
  Check the first few bytes of a file to determine if the file can be read by
  this reader.  You can assume that the first byte of the array corresponds to
  the first byte of the file.  Return true if the file can be read; false if
  not (or if there is no way of checking).

int getImageCount(String) throws FormatException, IOException :
  Return the number of image planes in the file.  This method should begin
  by checking if the given argument is equal to the current file; if not,
  initFile(String) should be called (see below).

boolean isRGB(String) throws FormatException, IOException :
  This should only return true if the file's image planes are stored as RGB
  or indexed color.  All other cases return false.  This method should begin
  by checking if the given argument is equal to the current file; if not,
  initFile(String) should be called (see below).

boolean isLittleEndian(String) throws FormatException, IOException :
  Return the byte ordering of the pixel data.  Note that in some cases, this
  is different from the file's native ordering.  If the pixel data is
  guaranteed to have 8 bits per pixel, then isLittleEndian can return
  anything. This method should begin by checking if the given argument is equal 
  to the current file; if not, initFile(String) should be called (see below).

boolean isInterleaved(String) throws FormatException, IOException :
  This is only relevant if the file's image planes are stored as RGB or
  indexed color; however, it should always be implemented.  If the image
  planes are RGB, and the pixel data is stored as "RRR...GGG...BBB", then
  return false.  Otherwise, if the pixel data is stored as "RGBRGBRGB..."
  return true.  This method should begin by checking if the given argument 
  is equal to the current file; if not, initFile(String) should be called 
  (see below).

byte[] openBytes(String, int) throws FormatException, IOException :
  Returns a byte array containing the pixel data for the specified image from
  the given file.  Should throw a FormatException if the image number is invalid
  (less than 0 or >= the number of images).  The ordering of the array
  returned by openBytes should correspond to the values returned by
  isLittleEndian(String) and isInterleaved(String).  Also, the length of the
  byte array should be [image width * image height * bytes per pixel].  Extra
  bytes will generally be truncated.  This method should begin
  by checking if the given argument is equal to the current file; if not,
  initFile(String) should be called (see below).

BufferedImage openImage(String, int) throws FormatException, IOException :
  Basically the same as openBytes, but returns a java.awt.image.BufferedImage
  instead of a byte array.  In general, the easiest way to implement this is
  by getting the corresponding byte array from openBytes, then returning
  loci.formats.ImageTools.makeImage(byte[], int width, int height, int
  numberOfChannels, boolean isInterleaved, int bytesPerPixel, boolean
  isLittleEndian).

void close() throws FormatException, IOException :
  Close the stream used to read the file, and set the stream and file name to
  null.  It is also very important to free any resources initialized elsewhere
  in the reader.  After calling close on a reader, any additional calls to
  that reader should result in a call to initFile(String).

protected void initFile(String) throws FormatException, IOException :
  The majority of the file parsing logic should be placed in this method.  The
  idea is to call this method once (and only once!) when the file is first
  opened.  Generally, you will want to start by calling
  super.initFile(String).  You will also need to set up the stream for reading
  the file, as well as initializing any dimension information and metadata.
  Most of this logic is up to you; however, it is wise to set the following
  variables:
    int sizeX[0] : the image width
    int sizeY[0] : the image height
    int sizeZ[0] : number of planes along Z axis (set to 1 if there are none)
    int sizeC[0] : the number of channels (set to 3 if RGB/indexed color)
    int sizeT[0] : number of planes along T axis (set to 1 if there are none)
    String currentOrder[0] : the dimension ordering of the planes
    int pixelType[0] : corresponds to the number of bytes per pixel; see 
                       constant values in FormatReader for a list of valid
                       values

  Note that each variable is intialized to 0 or null when
  super.initFile(String) is called.
  Also, super.initFile(String) constructs a Hashtable called "metadata" where
  you should store any relevant metadata.

static void main(String[]) throws FormatException, IOException :
  Consists of the following line:
    "new <class name>().testRead(args);"

Note that if the new format is a variant of a format currently supported by
Bio-Formats, it is more efficient to make the new reader a subclass of the
existing reader (rather than subclassing FormatReader).  In this case, it is
usually sufficient to override initFile(String) and isThisType(byte[]).

---=== Other useful things ===---

- loci.formats.RandomAccessStream is a hybrid RandomAccessFile/InputStream
  class that is generally more efficient than either RandomAccessFile or
  InputStream, and implements the DataInput interface.
  It is recommended that you use this for reading binary files.

- loci.formats.DataTools provides a number of methods for converting bytes to
  shorts, ints, longs, etc.  It also supports reading most primitive types
  directly from a RandomAccessStream (or other DataInput implementation).

- loci.formats.ImageTools provides several methods for manipulating
  java.awt.image.BufferedImage objects.  In particular, it can create
  BufferedImages from primitive type arrays, resize images, split RGB images
  into 3 grayscale images, and so on.  Consult the source or javadoc for more
  information.

- If your reader relies on third-party code which may not be available to all 
  users, it is strongly suggested that you access this code only through a
  loci.formats.ReflectedUniverse object.  For an example of how this works,
  see loci.formats.in.ZeissZVIReader.

- Several common image compression types are supported in
  loci.formats.Compression.  These include LZW, LZO, Base64, ZIP and RLE.

- If you wish to convert a file's metadata to OME-XML (strongly encouraged),
  loci.formats.OMEXMLMetadataStore provides methods for creating OME-XML from
  metadata values.  Note that OMEXMLMetadataStore is a subclass of 
  loci.formats.MetadataStore (every subclass of FormatReader keeps an instance
  of MetadataStore by default); so to add OME-XML support is as simple as
  calling getMetadataStore(String) on a format reader instance, and then
  calling the appropriate "set" methods as documented in OMEXMLMetadataStore.

- Utility methods for reading and writing individual bits from a byte array
  can be found in loci.formats.BitBuffer and loci.formats.BitWriter

- Once you have written your file format reader, add a line to the readers.txt
  file with the fully qualified name of the reader, followed by a '#' and the
  file extensions associated with the file format. Note that ImageReader,
  the master file format reader, tries to identify which format reader to use
  according to the order given in readers.txt, so be sure to place your reader
  in an appropriate position within the list.

- The easiest way to test your new reader is by calling "java
  loci.formats.ImageReader <file name>".  If all goes well, you should see
  all of the metadata and dimension information, along with a window showing
  the images in the file.  ImageReader can take additional parameters; a
  brief listing is provided for reference, but it is recommended that you
  take a look at the contents of FormatReader.testRead to see exactly what
  each one does.

    Argument            Action
    --------------------------
    -nopix              Read metadata only; don't display images.
    -nometa             Output only core metadata (dimension information).
    -thumbs             Read thumbnails instead of regular images.
    -merge              Combine separate channels into a set of RGB images.
    -stitch             Open all files with a similar name.
    -separate           Force RGB images to be split into separate channels.
    -nocolors           Intepret indexed color images as grayscale.
    -omexml             Output the OME-XML for the file.
    -range              Specify a range of images to open.
    -series             Set the series number (for container file formats).

- For more details, please look at the source code and javadocs.  Studying
  existing readers is probably the best way to get a feel for the API; I would
  recommend first looking at loci.formats.in.ImarisReader (this is the most
  straightforward one).  loci.formats.in.LIFReader and ZeissZVIReader are also
  good references that show off some of the nicer features of Bio-Formats.
