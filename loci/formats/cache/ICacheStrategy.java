/**
 * Interface for cache strategies. A cache strategy identifies which
 * objects should be loaded into the cache, in which order. Unlike
 * {@link ICacheSource}, it works with multidimensional (N-D) position arrays
 * rather than rasterized (1-D) indices. The two are made equivalent via a
 * mapping between the two, invoked within {@link Cache} as needed.
