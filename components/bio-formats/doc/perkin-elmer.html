<b>File format name:</b> Perkin-Elmer Ultraview<br>
<b>Maintainer:</b> <a href="http://www.perkin-elmer.com">Perkin Elmer</a><br>

<b>Structure:</b><br>

Each dataset contains 4 or more metadata files with any of these extensions:
.HTM, .csv, .tim, .zpo, .ano, .cfg, .rec, ...<br>
Pixel data is stored separately (one plane per file), in TIFF format (.tif
extension) or as raw data (variable length hexadecimal extension). Raw data
files have six magic bytes at the beginning of the file, which should be
skipped. The metadata files do not indicate which format the pixels files are
in - the directory must be manually searched.
<b>Thus, it is very important
that all files in a Perkin-Elmer dataset are stored in the same directory.
Also, none of the files should be renamed, or else the entire dataset will
likely be unreadable.</b><br>
Metadata files are usually HTML, XML or plain-text (key/value pairs); the data
they contain varies, but typically includes dimension information and basic
instrumentation settings.
