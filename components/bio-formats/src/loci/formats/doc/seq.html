This is a TIFF variant with two extra tags: 50288 and 40105. The purpose of
50288 is unknown; in all of our samples it is an array of 12 shorts, and the
values are equal across all files (presumably it is some sort of format
identifier). The 40105 tag contains the frame rate.<br><br>

In several of our samples, the TIFF comment contains the Z, C and T dimensions;
however, this is not guaranteed to be the case.
